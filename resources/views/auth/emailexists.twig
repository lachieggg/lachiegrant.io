  <h1>Hi there!</h1>

  It seems like you already have an account registered with that email address.
  <br>
  <br>
  Would you like to <a href="{{ path_for('auth.signin') }}">sign in</a> instead?
  <br>
  <br>
  If not, please try <a href="{{ path_for('auth.signup') }}">signing up</a> with a different email address.
