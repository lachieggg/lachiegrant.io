  <h1>Hi there!</h1>
  <br>
  It seems like you already have an account registered with that email address.
  <br>
  <br>
  Would you like to <a href="{{ path_for('auth.sign-in') }}">sign in</a> instead?
  <br>
  <br>
  Otherwise, please try <a href="{{ path_for('auth.sign-up') }}">signing up</a> with a different email address.
  </body>
