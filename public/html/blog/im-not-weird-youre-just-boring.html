			How to fit and be "normal" in modern society:
			<ul>
				<li>Don't be poor</li>
				<li>Don't act on your creative impulses or intellectual curiosity</li>
			</ul>
			Oh and don't piss off anybody too important. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Did I mention don't be poor?
			<br>
			<br>
			90% of what people mean when they talk about "being normal" is basically about not being poor.
			<br>
			<br>
			There are only some things worth sacrificing for the sake of appearances.
			<br>
			<br>
			I think it's pretty sad that we live in a culture that is as superficial as ours seems to be.
			<br>
			<br>
			Programming is something that is by a lot of people typically considered weird, until people realize how well it pays.
			<br>
			<br>
			Which is sad, because I've always thought it was cool, regardless of what it pays. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Now so many people also think programming is cool, but just because of the salary.
			<br>
			<br>
			People should just pursue what they love. Thankfully what I love pays well, many people aren't so lucky.
			<br>
			<br>
			For me programming is and always will be cool.
