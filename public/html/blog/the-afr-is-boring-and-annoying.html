			<b> Nine Fairfax is boring and annoying </b>
			<br>
			<br>
			There is an <a href="https://www.afr.com/policy/economy/why-crypto-is-gambling-and-not-investing-20220123-p59qkm">article</a> in the AFR talking about how crypto is "gambling and not investing".
			<br>
			<br>
			It was written by someone who clearly knows absolutely nothing about cryptography or computer science.
			<br>
			<br>
			No problem with not knowing anything about those topics, but don't pretend you understand Blockchain just because you're a Professor of Finance.
			<br>
			<br>
			This is what I've come to expect from the AFR also known as Channel 9 or Fairfax Media.

			His lack of understanding is kind of funny in the context of his photo which has a real <b> "I don't understand technology"</b> feel to it.
			<br>
			<br>
			Finance and cryptocurrencies are not the same thing. Just because someone knows about Finance does not mean they necessarily know about Blockchain/Crypto.
			<br>
			<br>
			And since many don't understand the underlying technology, who are they to say it's a speculative investment?
			<br>
			<br>
			Professor Davis should stick to writing about things he's actually an expert in.
