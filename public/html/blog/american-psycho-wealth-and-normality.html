			<b>American Psycho: The relationship between wealth and subjective normality</b>
			<br>
			<br>
			I'll wager that some people think that the main moral of the story in American Psycho is that our society is patriarchal. In fact the main focus is on the superficiality of our culture, irrespective of gender. Although there are examples of blatant misogyny in the story, these are used mainly as a means to convey the shallow nature of our broader society in the 1980s. With the rise of social media, it would be hard to argue much has changed. The author remains at least relatively impartial to issues of gender, and to think that ideas of gender are the main focus of the novel, would be a mistake. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Another misconception about American Psycho is that it is "just a work of fiction". Although Patrick is fictional, one need not look far back in time to find instances of real Wall Street Financiers that have committed atrocities on the level of Bateman. Many of them very famous and powerful.
			<br>
			<br>
			The focus is on the superficiality of our culture, that a psychopathic killer could live amongst the working elite, without anyone realizing. It reflects incredibly poorly on everybody else in the story to think that none of them could ever realize Patrick was a killer. Everyone is too busy doing drugs, and focusing on their perceived social status through expensive clothing, jewelry and real estate. This is true of both men and women in the story. Some of the women sell themselves for money at the expense of their own bodies, others cheat on their partners and numb themselves with drugs while doing so. Most of the men are doing more or less the same thing, cheating on their partners, lusting after women and snorting cocaine.

			In addition to the theme of exposing the obsession with status, financial or otherwise, within our culture, American Psycho emphasizes the incredible lack of insight and interest that people take in other people's mental health. Despite being clinically insane, Patrick Bateman is able to lead a somewhat normal life in the eyes of his peers. It would be hard to argue that this would be possible without his high paying wall street job, and expensive apartment. People consider him to be normal, partly because they are oblivious, but also because he is of high socio-economic status. 
			<br>
			<br>
			People constantly mistake him for other people in the story, showing how his persona is totally unremarkable and normal, despite his incredibly chaotic internal world. Although the conversation around wealth and its relationship to normality and sanity has changed slightly since the 1980s, it's still hard to distinguish between the two today. If Patrick had happened to be poor, there is no doubt his behaviour would have been treated and interpreted <i>very</i> differently.
