		<b>Distinguishing between crypto markets and blockchain technology</b>
		<br>
		<br>
		There is nothing more time wasting than listening to "financial analysts" or "chief economists" trying to talk people out of buying cryptocurrencies.
		<br>
		<br>
		Why news outlets try to get financial service professionals with no background in computer science to explain blockchain to them is beyond me.
		<br>
		<br>
		People should understand the difference between Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies. If you want to learn about cryptocurrencies, you should understand the difference between the market and the technology
		<br>
		<br>
		Do you want to learn about technology or do you want to invest? Personally I want to do all of the above. They are related, but not identical. When financial analysts look at cryptocurrencies, they see it only from the perspective of finance. They see price volatility, and they see an asset class that was created by some cypherpunk figure. But they are missing the rest of the picture. 
		<br>
		<br>
		If you want to invest, you should learn about data science, economics, finance, and maths. If you want to learn about Blockchain, you should learn about public key cryptography, digital signatures, hash functions, merkle trees, distributed network architecture, and of course, maths.
		<br>
		<br>
		If you want to understand the whole picture, you should understand all the above. It is disheartening that the finance people just see a volatile asset and say that it's a bubble, and the computer scientists see a data structure and network architecture. It's both.
		<br>
		<br>
		At least Charlie Munger accepts the fact that there is "probably some pretty innovative computer science behind blockchain". People should always make the distinction between cryptocurrencies and blockchain. Blockchain is a technology. It's here to stay.
		<br>
		<br>
		You can ban cryptocurrencies. You can't ban blockchain, because blockchain is a data structure and network architecture. That would be like banning email, TCP/IP, or HTTP. It's a protocol, you can't ban a protocol.
