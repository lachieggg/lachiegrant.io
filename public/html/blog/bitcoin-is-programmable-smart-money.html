			<b>Bitcoin is programmable, smart money</b>
			<br>
			<br>
			Bitcoin, or blockchains more generally, are the best networks for moving money around with Smart Devices. Why? Because they are part of the open monetary network. Blockchains are implicitly "Smart" in that they live completely online in an open and programmable system. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Consider the instance of paying for something using your Amazon Alexa or Google Home. I want to pay you $20 to split dinner. You could connect your Amazon Alexa to your bank account perhaps. But then how many banks are there? Now Amazon has to keep track of 4 different banking applications, and that's just the major banks in Australia. There are over 11,000 banks in the USA.
			<br>
			<br>
			How about a better use case. Someone who has emigrated to a developed nation to send money back to their family who are in a 3rd world country. They might say "Alexa pay my friend $20 using my bank account". Alexa says, can't do that because we don't integrate with that bank, or that bank does not allow Alexa to make transactions. Your bank doesn't support Osko? 3-5 business days. Transferring internationally? 3-5 business days. Or what about if your family doesn't even have banking infrastructure in their country? Then expect to lose 20% of what you earned on transaction fees. These are the kinds of things that just aren't a problem in Blockchain space.
			<br>
			<br>
			The smart device world is the always online world. Cryptocurrencies are 24/7, as they are global and borderless. NYSE? 9-5 Mon to Fri. ASX? 9-5 Mon to Fri. This is traditional financial infrastructure that has not and cannot adapt to the age of the Internet as fast as the Blockchain can and will. Why? Because it is old technology, analog technology, with modern tech infrastructure tacked on top of it. With all things analog, there comes a time where the paradigm shift has come in and it cannot adapt any further. It becomes a Frankenstein of modifications to allow everything new in the world to run on the system. 
			<br>
			<br>
			But for Blockchain, It's simple. Transactions with various networks are almost instantaneous. The API is open to the public, the source code is public, everyone can integrate with it, there are no bureaucratic issues with sending money between certain banks. It just works. Open architecture is always the design that wins, just look at Linux, or Wikipedia. Anything open like that becomes the de facto standard of how things operate. 
			<br>
			<br>
			In many ways Bitcoin is the Internet of money, because it is programmable money. It's dynamic money. Blockchain networks like Ethereum also have "Smart Contracts" which are programmable applications that live on the Blockchain and are hence decentralized.
			<br>
			<br>
			In terms of cybersecurity, Using bank accounts for the Smart Device banking use case is also potentially a security nightmare, now Amazon has to securely store your private API key for integrating with the banks. What if they have a security breach? Now all the API keys are exposed for all the different banking applications. It's storing it all in one place. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies generally are built from the ground up in the age of the Internet, and they are the native currencies of the Internet.
