			I love the way central bankers issue "warnings" about cryptocurrencies, as if all retail investors were just mindless sheep who have no idea about finance or investing.
			<br>
			<br>
			For instance:
			<br>
			<br>
			<i>Australia's central bank has issued caution over heavy investments in cryptocurrency, flagging its long-term use as highly sceptical.</i>
			<br>
			<br>
			It's the same thing that hedge funds would have said about investing in GameStop. 
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Extreme caution</b> is necessary when investing in the stock market! Only the experts know how to do it! It's very dangerous! You could lose all your money! Stay away!
			<br>
			<br>
			Which is basically another way of saying, "Go away this is our game, retail investors are not allowed to make money the way we do."
