			<b>Source Code (2011)</b>
			<br>
			<br>
			This is a quick summary of the ideas that sprang to mind immediately after re-watching the 2011 movie
			Source Code. 
			<br>
			<br>
			A quick run-down of the film, with spoilers. Source code is a film about a man in the
			US Military named Captain Colter Stevens, who comes back from deployment in a condition that puts him
			close to death. He has certain psychological characteristics that make him eligible to be involved in the
			Source Code program, which is an experimental lab that attempts to uncover the perpetrators of terror
			attacks in the United States. It does this by placing a subject into a kind of simulation, wherein their brain
			is modified to allow them access to memories of another person who witnessed the attack. Using the supposed
			short term memory of the witness, the subject goes into the circumstances of the attack and uncovers the
			perpetrator. They can go back into this simulation as many times as they want, and each time they uncover
			new parts of the situation that present clues.
			<br>
			<br>
			There are a variety of different interpretations to this film, none of which are necessarily more or less
			correct than any others. What is important to me is to consider a variety of possibilities that are interesting,
			and articulate them. This film, from my perspective, is all about recursion, loops, meta, sub-realities and frames of reference.
			Some consider this to be about time travel or alternate timelines. My perspective is more linear in the sense
			that the story can have consistency to it when considered from a certain point of view.
			<br>
			<br>
			The film begins by strongly defining reality as the meta reality that Goodwin and Dr. Rutledge are in,
			the reality in which a train has been attacked, and this is what makes unravelling it a mind teaser. We are conditioned by the way Goodwin speaks about "real lives" and the way Dr. Rutledge
			talks about how the Captain is just a hand on a clock to consider his perspective as lesser than theirs.
			They, and by implication the audience, consider his reality to be "less real" than their own. Goodwin takes his request to be killed after he solves the mystery into consideration and acts on it, terminating him after his last 8 minutes
			inside the simulation against the wishes of Dr. Rutledge. In doing so she acknowledges and validates his consciousness as "real",
			and acknowledges his reality and frame of reference.
			<br>
			<br>
			Speaking of lesser and greater, we consider the possibility that Goodwin and Dr. Rutledge
			are actually in a simulation themselves. That is, instead of accepting the narrative that Goodwin and Dr. Rutledge provide,
			which is that they are in the meta-reality, consider the possibility that all of them, Goodwin, Dr. Rutledge and Captain Stevens,
			are all in a computer program. In this case, Captain Stevens is in a double simulation, Goodwin and Dr. Rutledge are
			also in a simulation, and that's why at the end, after Captain Stevens is terminated, she receives a text message, because her
			reality is directly linked with Captain Stevens through the meta program.
			<br>
			<br>
			In Computer Science and Mathematics there is the concept of recursion. In a recursive computer program, you will often solve a sub problem
			before you solve the meta problem. Fibonacci is an example of this, where in order to calculate <b>fib(k)</b> you must calculate
			<b>fib(k-1)</b>. Each calculation has a stack frame. So Goodwin and Dr. Rutledge are trying to calculate <b>fib(k)</b>,
			and in order to do so they must calculate <b>fib(k-1)</b>. In this kind of structure, information propagates from the bottom upwards.
			Captain Stevens is the <b>fib(k-1)</b> stack frame returning information back up to the <b>fib(k)</b> frame. Hence the possibility of communication
			between the two "realities". It could be that Goodwin and Dr. Rutledge are just another sub problem of a larger <b>fib(k+1)</b> process.
			<br>
			<br>
			To extend and elaborate on this possibility, consider the case where Goodwin and Dr. Rutledge are themselves
			part of a source code, trying to solve a problem for their meta reality military personnel, and it just so happens that in order
			to solve their problem, they needed a set of circumstances in which the train was not blown up. So now that they have that set of
			circumstances, they can go back and continue, on their mission.
			<br>
			<br>
			Overall I found this film to be rich with interesting ideas, and it has enough ambiguity in the ending to allow the viewer to consider
			their own interpretation. Despite certain scientific inaccuracies, this film succeeds in explaining the concept of recursion in a story
			while also appealing to a non-technical audience.
