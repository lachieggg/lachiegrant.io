		<b>Does social media make people more superficial?</b>
		<p>
		I contend that the medium of social media creates a level of superficiality and simplicity for two reasons. 
		<br>
		<br>
		One, because it is impossible to really communicate something online in as much detail as you could in person, hence experiences and emotions are represented as photographs and emoticons respectively. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Two, because when there are no social norms established with a particular medium, as is the case of anything new, the platform participants tend toward mimicking one another's actions in an attempt to establish normative social behavior. 
		<br>
		<br>
		It is self evident that a focus on one's online persona over and above the way one feels with people they interact with during a regular week is maladaptive.
		<br>
		<br>
		Another reason social media may give rise to superficiality, or even just distorted self perceptions are the ways in which one can be connected with people online whom they no longer have real life interaction with in an average month, or even a year.
		<br>
		<br>
		Hence it is important to, if one is to preserve their personality whilst also embracing new technology, to find freedom of expression online, be it in a long form medium or otherwise. Lest our online avatars and real life personalities become separated, which opposes collective psychological integration and individuation.
